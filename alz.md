# Azure Landing Zone Whiteboard

Time to put your architect hat on and exercise everything you just learned by designing an ALZ solution.

## Instructions

### Duration
90 minutes
- 75 designing solution
- 15 sharing solutions across teams
  
### Task
Work together as a team by leveraging the information you just learned, links to resources below, and the avaialble Azure SMEs to design an Azure Landing Zone solution addressing Contoso DB, Incâ€™s requirements below.

> NOTE: Any seasoned architect will tell you, "it depends," when asked how a solution should be designed. The same applies to this challenge - there is not a single "correct" answer.

## Challenge

### About Contoso DB, Inc

*Contoso DB, Inc* is the cloud native company behind the wildly popular NoSQL DB that finally solved one of NoSQLs biggest limitations - fast, scalable, multi-collection ACID transactions. They started as an OSS project and eventually moved to a freemium model in order to offer enterprise support and other value added services and products.

Although *Contoso DB, Inc* has had success growing revenue via their AWS, Azure, and GCP IaaS marketplace offerings, internal market research shows there is high demand for a fully managed SaaS offering. The research also shows equal demand for the SaaS solution across AWS and Azure customers; however, they don't have in-house expertise to build a secure and scalable SaaS offering in Azure...yet.

### Your Role and Mission (should you accept it)

Congratulations! You and your team were just hired as *Contoso DB, Inc's* Azure Architecture/Engineering teams. You have been tasked with designing a scalable and sustainable Azure environment for your Contoso DB SaaS product as well as the various planned internal IT applications.

The CTO recognizes there will be several iterations of the design as new requirements and considerations are discovered. For the first iteration, she is interested in the following design considerations:

- Azure AD Tenant Design (can we use a single Azure AD tenant or do we need two - one for IT and one for SaaS)
- Management group design
- Subscription design (both internal IT and multi-tenent SaaS)
- Thoughts on whether or not to use Azure Policy to implement security controls and if so, which policies/initiatives might make sense for initial design
- High-level RBAC design
- High-level network design

The CTO has also heard about the Azure Landing Zone accelerators and wants your opinion on whether an accelerator could be used as a starting point for your greenfield Azure environment.

### Stakeholders (and their requirements)

- CTO
  - Ensure the new greenfield Azure environment is scalable, sustainable, and adaptable to changing needs of the business
